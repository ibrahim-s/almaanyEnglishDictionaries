This addon helps you get the meaning of words or phrases through the almaany.com website.  
For this purpose, it uses a bunch of English-Other language dictionaries on the site.  
If you did not find your language between them, sorry, for that is all the dictionaries available and we tried to make use of them.  
and thus in order to use this addon, you need to be connected to the internet.  
Web site being used for that:
[almaany.com](https://www.almaany.com/en/dict/).

notice: most dictionaries used are bilingual, meaning that for instance, the English French dictionary translates from english to French and from French to English also.  
This addon does not have a default gesture  
but you can as always assign a new gesture for the addon going to:  
NVDA menu(NVDA+N)/Preferences/Input gestures/Almaany English Dictionaries.
